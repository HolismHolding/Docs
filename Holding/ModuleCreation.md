# Module creation

- We prefer [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
- Naming conventions:
    - DO NOT name it as a verb
    - DO NOT name it an infinitive form
    - DO NOT name it as an adjective or adverb
    - DO name it a simple noun
    - Pluralization is up to you
        - If you will have an entity type that is the same name of the module (for example Order entity type in Order module), then DO name your module plural
- Creation
    - Create a new repository in
        - HolismApi
        - HolismPanel
