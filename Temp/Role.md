# Role

Role is based on business categorization of work force.
For example, somebody who drives a car to transport you is called a driver. His role is driving.
Someone who teaches you is called a teacher. His role is teaching.

From the point of technical consideration, role is defined in [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control).
You can access this part, only if you are a teacher.
You can access another part, only if you are a driver.
